# Blackjack Java Assignment

This project is a full implementation of the Blackjack (21) card game in Java, based on the university assignment requirements.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- Supports multiple players and dealer logic
- Handles blackjack, bust, split, and double actions
- Tracks player money and round results
- Uses multiple decks with automatic reshuffling

## ðŸ—‚ File Structure

- `Card.java` â€“ Represents a single playing card
- `River.java` â€“ Manages the deck(s) of cards
- `Hand.java` â€“ Represents a player's or dealer's hand
- `CasinoCustomer.java` â€“ Models a playerâ€™s identity and wallet
- `Player.java` â€“ Handles a playerâ€™s round logic and actions
- `Dealer.java` â€“ Simulates the dealer's turn and resolves outcomes
- `Round.java` â€“ Runs a full round between dealer and players
- `BlackjackTable.java` â€“ Sets up the table and game loop
- `Blackjack.java` â€“ Entry point with the `main` method

## ðŸ›  How to Compile & Run

### 1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/BlackjackProject
```
### 2. Compile all Java files:

```bash
javac *.java
```

### 3. Run the game:
```bash
java Blackjack
```

### Example:
```bash
Give the number of players: 2
Give customer name and available money for player 1: Alice 100
Give customer name and available money for player 2: Bob 200
```

###Notes

If all players lose their money, the game ends.
The deck is automatically reshuffled when 25% or fewer cards remain.
You can test individual classes using their main methods.
